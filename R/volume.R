# R/volume.R
#
# Volume and volumetric overlap for the package's two 3D representations. The
# generics are declared in R/AllGenerics.R; this file holds the arithmetic.
#
# SpatEnvelope and SpatVoxel both describe a 3D domain over a 2D grid, but they
# store depth in dual roles -- the envelope as a per-cell value, the voxel as
# the layer index -- so the vertical extent is derived differently in each and
# each gets its own method rather than a shared SpatVolume one. See
# [SpatVolume-class].
#
# The internals both this file and R/intersect.R rely on (occupancy, presence,
# cell areas, grid and depth checks) live in R/utils-3d.R. Where two domains
# overlap is intersect_3d()'s job (R/intersect.R); this file only measures the
# result.

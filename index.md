# sharkabc3d

**sharkabc3d** (Shark and Ray Abiotic Covariates in 3 Dimensions) is an
R package for three-dimensional marine spatial analysis of sharks, rays,
and chimaeras.

The three-dimensional marine environment poses a unique challenge for
spatial analyses. Most conventional GIS workflows represent space as a
two-dimensional plane, an abstraction that fails to capture the range of
depths and vertical overlap of marine habitat. Fisheries also operate at
different depths depending on gear type and target species, creating
depth-specific patterns of threat exposure that require analysis in 3D
volume rather than 2D planes to quantify. `sharkabc3d` provides
documented workflows and reusable functions for:

- extracting values from depth-stratified oceanographic rasters within
  user-defined geographic areas and depth windows;
- characterising the abiotic habitat (e.g., temperature, dissolved
  oxygen) of marine species using IUCN Red List ranges and World Ocean
  Atlas 2023 climatologies;
- calculating three-dimensional overlap between species distributions,
  fisheries effort, and other spatial layers;
- producing depth-aware maps and depth-profile plots of species ranges,
  environmental conditions, and cumulative fishing pressure.

## How it works

All 3D analyses use a stacked-raster approach built on `terra` and `sf`.
Polygons (species ranges, fishery footprints) are rasterized onto a
common bathymetry-aware grid where each cell stores presence plus the
shallowest and deepest depths the feature occupies (clamped to the
seafloor). Volume overlap between two rasterized ranges is then computed
per-cell via raster algebra. Multi-depth environmental rasters (e.g.,
WOA temperature at 57 standard depths) follow a
`{variable}_depth={value}` layer-naming convention so that downstream
functions can select the correct layers for a given depth window.

## Function overview

### Loading and preparing input data

- [`load_gebco_bathymetry()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/load_gebco_bathymetry.md)
  — load a GEBCO bathymetry NetCDF as a `SpatRaster`.
- [`fetch_species_assessments()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/fetch_species_assessments.md)
  — query the IUCN Red List API for taxonomy, Red List category, and
  depth limits, by SIS ID, scientific name, or comprehensive group code.
- [`fill_missing_depths()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/fill_missing_depths.md)
  — fix swapped upper/lower depth values and fill missing values from
  genus-level means.

### Building the 3D study grid and rasterized ranges

- [`create_study_raster()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/create_study_raster.md)
  — build an empty study-area `SpatRaster` covering the combined extent
  of one or more spatial inputs.
- [`vect_to_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/vect_to_envelope.md)
  — rasterize a single species range or fishery footprint onto the study
  grid and attach per-cell `depth_min` / `depth_max`, returning a
  `SpatEnvelope`. Depth limits are lists mixing numerics and rasters, so
  bathymetry is just one more constraint: per cell the deepest
  `depth_min` and the shallowest `depth_max` win.

### 3D spatial query

Three verbs ask how a `SpatEnvelope` or `SpatVoxel` relates to another
object in 3D. The other object can be a 3D object too, or a 2D one: a
`SpatRaster` footprint or polygons (`SpatVector`, `sf`). A 2D object
restricts the domain horizontally and leaves its depths alone.

- `intersect_3d(x, y)` — the 3D space the two share. Returns an envelope
  with the shared depth interval, or a presence voxel.
- `intersects_3d(x, y)` — whether they share any 3D space, cell by cell:
  `TRUE`, `FALSE` (both present but disjoint, or only one present), or
  `NA` (neither present). Sum a stack of these for a richness map.
- `mask(x, mask)` —
  [`terra::mask()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/mask.html),
  made depth-aware. Keeps the values of `x` where the mask domain
  reaches that cell *at that depth*.

[`terra::intersect()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/intersect.html)
on a 3D object is an error that points to these, because terra’s version
ignores depth.

### 3D volume

Both dispatch on the 3D representation, so they take either a
`SpatEnvelope` or a `SpatVoxel`. A voxel’s volume sums the slab each
occupied depth level stands for, so interior gaps cost volume instead of
being filled in. Given one of each, the envelope is discretized onto the
voxel’s depth levels.

- [`volume()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/volume.md)
  — total 3D volume (km³) of a rasterized domain.
- [`calc_volume_overlap()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/calc_volume_overlap.md)
  — per-cell depth intervals and volumes for two rasterized domains and
  their intersection (returns a 9-layer stack). Built on
  [`intersect_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersect_3d.md).

### Environmental extraction (3D)

- [`depths()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/depths.md)
  — the depths a `SpatVoxel`’s layers stand for, parsed from the
  `{variable}_depth={value}` layer names. Also accepts a bare character
  vector of layer names.
- [`extract_to_area()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract_to_area.md)
  — crop a `SpatVoxel` to an area polygon and select layers within a
  depth range.

To restrict a `SpatVoxel` to a species’ *per-cell* depth window —
preserving each cell’s vertical refuge — mask it with the range
envelope:

``` r

mask(rast_3d, range_env)
```

See `vignette("woa-species-range-voxels")` for the full workflow, from a
range polygon through to summary statistics.

### World Ocean Atlas 2023 utilities

- [`woa_download()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_download.md)
  — download WOA 2023 NetCDF files (temperature, salinity, dissolved
  oxygen, oxygen saturation, AOU, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, density)
  at 0.25°, 1°, or 5° resolution, with caching.
- [`woa_load_nc()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_load_nc.md)
  — load a WOA NetCDF and select a statistical field (e.g., objectively
  analyzed climatology), returning a `SpatRaster` with the package’s
  standard `{variable}_depth={value}` layer names.
- `woa_nc_extract()` — extract layers for a chosen statistical field
  from an already-loaded WOA `SpatRaster`.
- `woa_summarise_monthly()` — compute min, max, and max-minus-min across
  monthly WOA files at each depth layer.
- [`woa_cache_dir()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_cache_dir.md)
  /
  [`woa_cache_clear()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_cache_clear.md)
  — manage the persistent WOA download cache.

### Global Fishing Watch (fisheries effort)

- [`gfw_effort_to_raster()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/gfw_effort_to_raster.md)
  — turn the long-format apparent-fishing-hours tibble from
  [`gfwr::gfw_ais_fishing_hours()`](https://globalfishingwatch.github.io/gfwr/reference/gfw_ais_fishing_hours.html)
  into a multi-layer `SpatRaster`, one layer per gear (or other
  grouping). Extending that into 3D uses the general converters —
  [`as_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_envelope.md)
  and
  [`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
  — driven by a gear-to-depth-band lookup. Those operating-depth priors
  are analysis assumptions rather than package data, so they live in the
  `gfw-fishing-effort-3d` article.

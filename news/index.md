# Changelog

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9005

The 3D object model. `SpatVoxel` / `SpatEnvelope` replace the ad-hoc “3D
raster” conventions, and the volumetric functions now dispatch on them.

### New classes and constructors

- `SpatVoxel` (one layer per standard depth, cell value is the variable)
  and `SpatEnvelope` (exactly `depth_min`/`depth_max`, cell value is
  depth): S4 classes extending
  [`terra::SpatRaster`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html)
  with their own validity rules. `SpatVolume` is a class union over the
  two and the dispatch target for volumetric operations, replacing the
  virtual `SpatDepthRaster`.
- [`as_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_voxel.md)
  /
  [`as_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_envelope.md)
  construct them. Prefer these over
  [`methods::new()`](https://rdrr.io/r/methods/new.html): they normalise
  as well as validate, and are idempotent, so re-wrapping after a terra
  operation that drops the class is cheap.
  [`as_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_voxel.md)
  accepts a conforming multi-depth `SpatRaster`, a list of single-depth
  rasters, or a `SpatVoxel`, and sorts layers shallow to deep.
  [`as_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_envelope.md)
  attaches depth limits to a 2D footprint: each limit is a single number
  or a per-cell single-layer `SpatRaster`, or `x` already carries the
  two depth layers.
- [`voxel_to_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/voxel_to_envelope.md)
  /
  [`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
  convert between the two, each taking a `fun` — an occupancy predicate
  one way (default `\(x) !is.na(x)`), a per-voxel profile the other.
  [`voxel_to_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/voxel_to_envelope.md)
  is lossy: an envelope is one continuous interval per cell, so interior
  gaps are filled.
- [`vect_to_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/vect_to_envelope.md)
  builds an envelope from polygons. `depth_min` / `depth_max` are lists
  mixing numerics and rasters; per cell the deepest `depth_min` and
  shallowest `depth_max` win, so bathymetry is just another constraint.
  Constraint rasters must match the template’s CRS, resolution and
  extent, and their NAs propagate rather than falling back to the
  remaining constraints.
- [`depths()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/depths.md),
  exported: the depths a voxel’s layers stand for, parsed from
  `{variable}_depth={value}` layer names. It accepts a `SpatVoxel`, any
  conforming `SpatRaster`, or a bare character vector, so
  `depths(rownames(terra::global(v, "sum")))` works.
- Depths are positive metres increasing downward throughout the 3D
  model. Negative depths are an error, not silently flipped.

### New spatial query verbs

Each takes a `SpatEnvelope` or `SpatVoxel` paired with another 3D
object, a 2D `SpatRaster` footprint, or polygons (`SpatVector`, `sf`,
`sfc`). A 2D object restricts the domain horizontally and leaves its
depths alone.

- `intersect_3d(x, y)` returns the 3D space the two share: an envelope
  with the shared depth interval, or a presence voxel. It is the one
  place that decides where two domains overlap;
  [`calc_volume_overlap()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/calc_volume_overlap.md)
  is now built on it, with unchanged numbers.
- `intersects_3d(x, y)` is the yes/no form: `TRUE` where both are
  present and their depths overlap, `FALSE` where both are present but
  disjoint or only one is, `NA` where neither is. terra’s own three-way
  answer, made depth-aware.
- [`mask()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/mask.html) gains
  depth-aware methods on terra’s generic, so the article idiom
  `terra::mask(v, envelope_to_voxel(range, depths(v)))` becomes
  `mask(v, range)`. A voxel masked by an envelope puts the envelope on
  the voxel’s depth levels first; a voxel masked by a voxel requires the
  same levels. Mismatched levels used to mask by layer position,
  silently; that is now an error.
- [`terra::intersect()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/intersect.html)
  on a `SpatEnvelope` or `SpatVoxel` is now an error naming
  [`intersects_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersects_3d.md)
  /
  [`intersect_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersect_3d.md).
  terra’s version is a 2D “both have data” test, and because terra keeps
  the subclass on its result, two envelopes 100 m apart came back as a
  `SpatEnvelope` of `TRUE` that passed validity.
- The verbs re-check tagged inputs and point to
  [`as_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_voxel.md)
  /
  [`as_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/as_envelope.md),
  since terra keeps the class tag through operations that change the
  layer set (`[[`,
  [`app()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/app.html)).

### Breaking changes

| before | after |
|----|----|
| `calc_volume(r)` | `volume(as_envelope(r))` |
| `calc_volume_overlap(range_rast_a = a, range_rast_b = b)` | `calc_volume_overlap(x = a, y = b)` |
| `count_3d_overlap(a, b)` | `intersects_3d(a, b)` |
| `extract_rast_range(range, v)` | `mask(v, range)` |
| `extract_rast_volume(area, min_depth = 40, max_depth = 600, rast_3d = v)` | `extract_to_area(area, v, min_depth = 40, max_depth = 600)` |
| `voxelize_range(poly, voxel, depth_min = 0, depth_max = 500)` | `vect_to_envelope(poly, template, depth_min = 0, depth_max = list(500, seafloor))` |
| `create_study_voxel(template, bathymetry, depths)` | no replacement object — pass the three separately (the `study_voxel` class and its [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method go too) |
| `summarise_species_environment()` | `summarise_range()` in `vignette("woa-environmental-extraction")` |
| `voxel_to_envelope(fun = "extent" \| "threshold")` | `voxel_to_envelope(fun = <predicate>)` |

- [`volume()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/volume.md)
  (was `calc_volume()`, matching how terra names
  [`area()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/expanse.html))
  and
  [`calc_volume_overlap()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/calc_volume_overlap.md)
  are S4 generics on the 3D classes, so they accept a `SpatVoxel` as
  well as a `SpatEnvelope`, with formals `x` / `y`. The class is now the
  contract: a bare `SpatRaster` carrying `depth_min`/`depth_max` layers
  is rejected rather than duck-typed. A voxel’s volume sums the slab
  each occupied level stands for, so interior gaps cost volume rather
  than being filled in; given one envelope and one voxel, the envelope
  is discretized onto the voxel’s levels. Both now check that their
  inputs share a grid instead of reusing the first argument’s cell areas
  for the second. Envelope volumes are numerically unchanged.
- `count_3d_overlap()` is retired for
  [`intersects_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersects_3d.md),
  which returns `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`NA` instead of `1`/`NA`.
  `sum(stack, na.rm = TRUE)` over a stack of results still gives a
  richness map, now with a real `0` where a domain is present but
  nothing overlaps it.
- [`extract_to_area()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract_to_area.md)
  (was `extract_rast_volume()`) takes the target first and the source
  second, as
  [`extract_to_point()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract_to_point.md)
  does, and its depth bounds are optional and named. It requires and
  returns a `SpatVoxel`, accepts `sfc` areas alongside `sf` and
  `SpatVector`, and compares CRS with
  [`terra::same.crs()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/same.crs.html)
  rather than string equality on WKT.
- [`vect_to_envelope()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/vect_to_envelope.md)
  requires `polygon` and `template` to already share a CRS rather than
  projecting silently.
- `summarise_species_environment()` was analysis rather than package
  machinery. Its column contract (`{name}_min`, `_max`, `_mean`,
  `_n_surface_cells`, `_n_cells`, `_n_depths`) is unchanged in the
  vignette helper.
- `R/extract.R` is retired — it re-derived by hand what the classes now
  guarantee. `methods` moves into Imports.

### Bug fixes

- `mask(v, range)` also fixes a depth bug in `extract_rast_range()`,
  which tested exact point containment, so an envelope falling between
  two depth levels occupied none of them: `[10, 20]` against depths
  `c(0, 100, 200)` came back empty.
  [`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
  tests slab overlap instead, so the same envelope now occupies the 0 m
  level, and its `bounds` argument chooses where the slab edges fall
  (`"top"` or the World Ocean Atlas `"midpoint"`).
- Touching is not overlapping, for voxels as well as envelopes.
  [`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
  used to record an envelope at a level whose slab it merely ended on,
  so `[0, 100]` and `[100, 200]` both occupied the 100 m level and their
  voxels intersected, while
  [`intersect_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersect_3d.md)
  on the same two envelopes said they did not. The occupancy test is now
  strict on the envelope’s floor: a level is occupied only where the
  envelope shares some thickness of water with its slab. Adjacent depth
  ranges therefore land on disjoint levels, and
  [`intersect_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersect_3d.md),
  [`intersects_3d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/intersects_3d.md),
  [`mask()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/mask.html) and
  [`calc_volume_overlap()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/calc_volume_overlap.md)
  give the envelope answer whichever types they are handed. Two
  consequences: an envelope ending exactly at a level no longer occupies
  that level, and under `"top"` an envelope ending at `max(depths)` is
  not recorded at the deepest level, which stands for a zero-thickness
  slab.
- [`calc_volume_overlap()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/calc_volume_overlap.md)
  returned its nine-layer stack tagged `SpatEnvelope`. It is now the
  plain `SpatRaster` its documentation describes.

### Documentation and internals

- New article `vignette("woa-species-range-voxels")`: a species range
  polygon to a `SpatEnvelope`, applied to a WOA-shaped `SpatVoxel`,
  through to the overlapping voxel values and their summaries. Unlike
  the other articles it is fully synthetic and runs, so it doubles as a
  worked check of the idioms.
- Helpers shared by `R/volume.R` and the new `R/intersect.R` move to
  `R/utils-3d.R`. The constructors work on plain copies of their input,
  so a voxel layer can serve as a footprint without its class tag
  reaching the depth-aware
  [`mask()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/mask.html)
  methods.

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9004

- [`gfw_effort_to_raster()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/gfw_effort_to_raster.md)
  can infer grid resolution and extent from the input data frame.

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9003

- Breaking: `load_bathymetry()` is renamed
  [`load_gebco_bathymetry()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/load_gebco_bathymetry.md)
  and moves from `R/load_data.R` to `R/gebco_bathymetry.R`. The new name
  makes the expected data source explicit; the function is otherwise
  unchanged.
- Runnable examples for
  [`load_gebco_bathymetry()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/load_gebco_bathymetry.md)
  — building a small stand-in NetCDF rather than requiring a
  multi-gigabyte GEBCO download
  ([\#37](https://github.com/Marine-Biodiversity-Conservation-Lab/sharkabc3d/issues/37))
  — and for
  [`fill_missing_depths()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/fill_missing_depths.md),
  which moves to `R/iucn_utils.R` alongside the
  [`fetch_species_assessments()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/fetch_species_assessments.md)
  depth limits it repairs.

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9002

- [`extract_to_point()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract_to_point.md)
  generalises point extraction from netCDF files, taking data frames,
  tibbles, `sf` POINT objects, matrices, named lists, and bare
  longitude/latitude/depth/date values or vectors. It preserves input
  structure where appropriate and transforms projected `sf` coordinates
  to longitude/latitude when possible.
- Runnable synthetic 2D and 3D netCDF examples for
  [`extract_to_point()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract_to_point.md),
  [`extract2d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract2d.md),
  [`extract3d_surface()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_surface.md),
  [`extract3d_bottom()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_bottom.md),
  [`extract3d_nearest()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_nearest.md)
  and
  [`extract3d_all()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_all.md).

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9001

- Retire `R/plot.R`. The `plot_*()` functions were used by a single
  article and are no longer exported; `plot_depth_profile()` and
  `plot_range_at_depth()` now live inline in the WOA environmental
  extraction articles. `ggplot2` and `tidyterra` move from Imports to
  Suggests.

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1.9000

- Deprecate `woa_nc_extract()`, folding it into
  [`woa_load_nc()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_load_nc.md),
  its only caller.
  [`woa_load_nc()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/woa_load_nc.md)
  now checks for layer names that don’t follow the package convention.

## sharkabc3d 0.1.1

- Add NetCDF extraction to observation points
  ([\#6](https://github.com/Marine-Biodiversity-Conservation-Lab/sharkabc3d/issues/6),
  [@davidruizgarci](https://github.com/davidruizgarci))

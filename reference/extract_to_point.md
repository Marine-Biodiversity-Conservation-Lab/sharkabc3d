# Extract values from netCDFs to one or more point observations

This is the general point-extraction interface. It can extract
environmental values for one or multiple observations. The user chooses
the type of extraction with the `method` argument. The more specific
functions
[`extract2d()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract2d.md),
[`extract3d_surface()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_surface.md),
[`extract3d_bottom()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_bottom.md),
[`extract3d_nearest()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_nearest.md)
and
[`extract3d_all()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/extract3d_all.md)
are wrappers around this function.

## Usage

``` r
extract_to_point(
  data = NULL,
  nc,
  lon = NULL,
  lat = NULL,
  depth = NULL,
  date = NULL,
  var = NULL,
  method = c("2d", "surface", "bottom", "nearest", "all"),
  lon_col = "lon",
  lat_col = "lat",
  date_col = "date",
  depth_col = "depth",
  id_col = NULL,
  file_col = "file",
  lon_dim = NULL,
  lat_dim = NULL,
  depth_dim = NULL,
  time_dim = NULL,
  time_match = c("nearest", "exact"),
  max_time_diff = NULL,
  output_prefix = NULL,
  output_col = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Optional object containing observation points. Can be a data frame,
  tibble, `sf` object with POINT geometries, matrix with column names,
  or named list. If `NULL`, coordinates can be supplied directly through
  `lon`, `lat`, and optionally `depth` and `date`. For `sf` objects,
  longitude and latitude are obtained from the POINT geometries;
  projected geometries are transformed internally to longitude and
  latitude when a CRS is available.

- nc:

  netCDF source. Can be a file path, vector of file paths, list of file
  paths, opened `ncdf4` object, list of opened objects, or a data frame
  with a file column.

- lon:

  Optional numeric longitude value or vector for direct point extraction
  when `data = NULL`.

- lat:

  Optional numeric latitude value or vector for direct point extraction
  when `data = NULL`.

- depth:

  Optional numeric observation depth value or vector for direct point
  extraction. Required when `data = NULL` and `method = "nearest"` or
  `method = "all"`.

- date:

  Optional observation date or vector of dates for direct point
  extraction. Used when `data = NULL` and the netCDF variable has a time
  dimension. Character dates should use `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format. Direct
  input vectors may have length 1 or a common compatible length.

- var:

  Name of the variable to extract from the netCDF file. If `NULL`, the
  function tries to detect the variable automatically from each file.
  This only works when each netCDF file contains one single variable.

- method:

  Extraction method. Options are `"2d"`, `"surface"`, `"bottom"`,
  `"nearest"` and `"all"`. With `method = "all"`, the function returns
  nearest, surface and bottom outputs together.

- lon_col:

  Name of the longitude column in `data`.

- lat_col:

  Name of the latitude column in `data`.

- date_col:

  Name of the date column in `data`. Required only when the netCDF
  variable has a time dimension.

- depth_col:

  Name of the observation-depth column in `data`. Required only when
  `method = "nearest"` or `method = "all"`.

- id_col:

  Optional observation identifier column. It is not required for
  extraction, but it is checked when provided to help users detect
  mistakes.

- file_col:

  Column containing file paths when `nc` is a data frame.

- lon_dim:

  Optional name of the longitude dimension in the netCDF file.

- lat_dim:

  Optional name of the latitude dimension in the netCDF file.

- depth_dim:

  Optional name of the depth dimension in the netCDF file.

- time_dim:

  Optional name of the time dimension in the netCDF file.

- time_match:

  Character. How observation dates are matched to netCDF time values.
  `"nearest"` (default) selects the closest available date; `"exact"`
  requires an exact date match and returns `NA` when no match exists.

- max_time_diff:

  Optional non-negative numeric value giving the maximum allowed
  difference, in days, between an observation date and the nearest
  netCDF date when `time_match = "nearest"`. If `NULL` (default), no
  maximum temporal distance is imposed. Ignored when
  `time_match = "exact"`.

- output_prefix:

  Optional name used for the extracted output column. If omitted, `var`
  is used.

- output_col:

  Optional alias for `output_prefix`. Use this when you want to define
  the exact name of the output column directly. If both `output_col` and
  `output_prefix` are provided, `output_col` is used. With
  `method = "all"`, this name is used as the suffix in `nearest_*`,
  `surface_*` and `seabottom_*` columns.

- verbose:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, progress messages are printed every 100 rows.

## Value

If `data` is provided, the input observations with extracted values
appended. Data frames, tibbles and `sf` objects retain their structure;
matrices and named lists are returned as data frames. If `data = NULL`,
direct extraction returns a numeric value for one point and one output,
a numeric vector for multiple points and one output, a named numeric
vector for one point and multiple outputs (for example,
`method = "all"`), or a data frame for multiple points and multiple
outputs.

## Examples

``` r
nc_file <- system.file(
  "extdata", "example_3d.nc",
  package = "sharkabc3d"
)

# Extract the value closest to a single observation
extract_to_point(
  nc = nc_file,
  lon = 0,
  lat = 40,
  depth = 60,
  date = "2020-01-03",
  var = "temp",
  method = "nearest"
)
#> [1] 15.5

# Extract values for multiple observations
extract_to_point(
  nc = nc_file,
  lon = c(0, 1),
  lat = c(40, 41),
  depth = c(60, 100),
  date = "2020-01-03",
  var = "temp",
  method = "nearest"
)
#> [1] 15.5 13.5
```

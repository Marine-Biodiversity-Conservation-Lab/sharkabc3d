# Vertical profiles for voxel building

A vertical profile decides how the value a cell carries is spread down
the depth levels that cell occupies.
[`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
takes one through its `profile` argument, as a function — either one of
these, or one you write.

## Usage

``` r
profile_flat(ind, depths, n_depths)

profile_equal(ind, depths, n_depths)
```

## Arguments

- ind:

  Logical SpatRaster of occupancy, one layer per depth.

- depths:

  Numeric vector of depths, shallow to deep, one per layer of `ind`.

- n_depths:

  Single-layer SpatRaster counting each cell's occupied levels.

## Value

A weight to multiply `ind` by: a single number, or a SpatRaster on the
grid of `ind` with either one layer or one per depth.

## Functions

- `profile_flat()`: The whole value at every occupied level. This is
  what `profile = NULL` means in
  [`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md);
  it exists as a function so the no-profile case is a profile like any
  other rather than a special case in the caller.

- `profile_equal()`: An even share at each occupied level, so the levels
  sum back to the cell's value. The share depends on how many levels the
  cell occupies, which varies across the grid wherever the envelope
  does: a cell spanning three levels gets a third at each, one spanning
  ten gets a tenth.

## Writing a profile

A profile is called once per
[`envelope_to_voxel()`](https://marine-biodiversity-conservation-lab.github.io/sharkabc3d/reference/envelope_to_voxel.md)
call, with three arguments, positionally:

- `ind`:

  Logical SpatRaster, one layer per depth, `TRUE` where a cell's
  envelope overlaps the slab that depth stands for — from the depth down
  to the next one, the deepest standing for itself alone. A level can
  therefore be occupied without its own value lying in the envelope.
  Cells that are `NA` in the envelope are `NA` here.

- `depths`:

  Numeric vector of the depths those layers stand for, shallow to deep.
  Always `terra::nlyr(ind)` long.

- `n_depths`:

  Single-layer SpatRaster counting the levels each cell occupies, i.e.
  `sum(ind)`. Passed in rather than left to be recomputed, since the
  caller already needs it.

It returns the weight that multiplies `ind`, in one of three forms: a
single number applying to the whole grid, a single-layer SpatRaster
giving one weight per cell, or a `terra::nlyr(ind)`-layer SpatRaster
giving one per cell per level. Rasters must be on the grid of `ind`.

Because a profile is handed rasters and returns rasters, write it in
terra algebra rather than in terms of one cell at a time. Unoccupied
cells are masked out by the caller afterwards, so a profile need not
zero them — but it should avoid dividing by a zero level count, since
`Inf` is harder to read in a partial result than `NA`.

A profile that conserves does so *per cell*: the weights it returns sum
to 1 within each cell, whatever that cell's interval.

## Examples

``` r
fp <- terra::rast(nrows = 1, ncols = 2, xmin = 0, xmax = 2, ymin = 0, ymax = 1)
terra::values(fp) <- c(1, 1)
dmax <- terra::setValues(terra::rast(fp), c(100, 300))
e <- as_envelope(fp, depth_min = 0, depth_max = dmax)
depths <- c(0, 100, 200, 300)

# the whole value at every occupied level
terra::values(envelope_to_voxel(e, depths, values = 12, profile = profile_flat))
#>      presence_depth=0 presence_depth=100 presence_depth=200 presence_depth=300
#> [1,]               12                 NA                 NA                 NA
#> [2,]               12                 12                 12                 NA

# an even share instead, so each cell's levels sum back to its value
terra::values(envelope_to_voxel(e, depths, values = 12, profile = profile_equal))
#>      presence_depth=0 presence_depth=100 presence_depth=200 presence_depth=300
#> [1,]               12                 NA                 NA                 NA
#> [2,]                4                  4                  4                 NA

# a profile of your own: weight the shallow levels twice as heavily as the
# deep ones, still conserving each cell's total
surface_weighted <- function(ind, depths, n_depths) {
  w <- terra::rast(lapply(depths, function(d) ifelse(d <= 100, 2, 1) * ind[[1]]))
  w <- w * ind
  w / sum(w)
}
terra::values(envelope_to_voxel(e, depths, values = 12,
                                profile = surface_weighted))
#>      presence_depth=0 presence_depth=100 presence_depth=200 presence_depth=300
#> [1,]             12.0                 NA                 NA                 NA
#> [2,]              4.8                4.8                2.4                 NA
```
